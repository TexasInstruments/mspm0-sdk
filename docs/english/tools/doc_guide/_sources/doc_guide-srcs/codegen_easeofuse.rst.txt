Code Generation and Ease-of-Use
=================================

SysConfig
----------------------
| `SysConfig <https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG>`_ is an intuitive and comprehensive collection of graphical utilities for configuring pins, peripherals, radios, subsystems, and other components.
| SysConfig helps you manage, expose and resolve conflicts visually so that you have more time to create differentiated applications.
|
| The tool's output includes C header and code files that can be used with software development kit (SDK) examples or used to configure custom software.
|
| The SysConfig tool automatically selects the pinmux settings that satisfy the entered requirements.
| The SysConfig tool is delivered integrated in CCS, as a standalone installer, or can be used via the dev.ti.com cloud tools portal.

Analog Configurator
----------------------
| The `TI Analog Configurator <https://dev.ti.com/gallery/view/TIMSPGC/AnalogConfigurator>`_ is a graphical configuration tool designed to simplify and accelerate the design and enablement of an analog signal chain using a MSPM0 device with no traditional coding development necessary.
| The tool uses an intuitive GUI to configure a signal chain using the high analog integration of MSPM0 devices, analyze and evaluate signals in real-time, and generate the configuration code necessary to flash the device.
|
| TI Analog Configurator utilizes SysConfig to automatically select pinmux settings based on the user's configuration.
| The tool can output a CCS project with the SysConfig analog configuration already completed for the user.
