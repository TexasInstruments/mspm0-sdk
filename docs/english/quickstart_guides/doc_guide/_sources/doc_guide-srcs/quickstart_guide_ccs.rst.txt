1. Introduction
---------------

This guide is intended to assist users in the initial setup and demonstration of running their first MSPM0 application with CCS using TI Arm Clang. This guide is not intended to explain the functionality of CCS. Please refer to the documentation available through the Help menu in CCS or the `CCS IDE Guide for MSPM0 MCUs <../../../tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html>`__ included with the MSPM0 SDK documentation.
