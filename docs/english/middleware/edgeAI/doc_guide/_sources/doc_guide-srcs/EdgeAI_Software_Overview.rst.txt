Edge AI Software Solution for MSPM0 Devices
===========================================

Overview
--------

The Edge AI Software solution for MSPM0 devices is a comprehensive framework designed to enable artificial intelligence capabilities on Texas Instruments' MSPM0 microcontroller units. This solution empowers developers to implement machine learning models directly on resource-constrained MSPM0 devices, enabling real-time inference at the edge with minimal power consumption.

Software Components in SDK
--------------------------

The Edge AI software solution consists of the following key components:

1. Feature Extraction Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Feature Extraction module provides capabilities to process raw sensor data and extract meaningful features that can be used as inputs to machine learning models. This component supports:

-  Signal processing functions
-  Time-domain feature extraction
-  Frequency-domain transformations (FFT)
-  Statistical feature calculations

The feature extraction library leverages ARM CMSIS-DSP functions for efficient signal processing operations on MSPM0 devices.

2. Neural Processing Unit (NPU) Driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The NPU component provides hardware acceleration for neural network inference by interfacing with the MSPM0's Neural Processing Unit. This driver:

-  Handles instruction memory management
-  Manages parameter memory
-  Provides control interfaces for NPU operations
-  Optimizes execution of neural network operations

The NPU driver is designed to be called by compiled neural network libraries built using TI's Neural Network Compiler (NNC) for MCUs. Note the NPU driver is only applicable for MSP devices with NPU.

3. Device Agent Protocol (Optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Communication interfaces for device management and data exchange between the MSPM0 device and Model Composer GUI. This is needed for the data capture and live preview features of the Model Composer. The communication interface is implemented using UART and is configurable for different data formats and baud rates.
