## Example Summary

This example will provide a beginning beta implementation of the boot image manger. It is comprised of all the necessary files and procedures in order to run application images. The default public key is image_signTEST found in ```source/third_party/mcuboot/```. This is an example with a companion example ```bim_sample_image``` that will provide application images that work with this boot application.

It is highly recommended to read the users guide found in```docs/*/middleware/boot_manager/Boot_Image_Manager_Users_guide.html``` prior to running the example.

## Requirements

The ECC and SHA libaries used by this example are compiled with TI Clang 4.0.0 with Link Time Optimization (LTO). This is not compatible
with previous versions of TI Clang (3.X and older). Thus, the user must download and use the updated TI Clang toolchain from [the product page](https://www.ti.com/tool/download/ARM-CGT-CLANG/4.0.0.LTS) if not installed already.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1306 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#manual-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Load any application image, such as those produced by the corresponding example ```bim_sample_image```.

If successful, this example will jump to a valid application. If unsuccessful, the example will flash the red LED.

Further discussion of this example is covered in the BIM Users's Guide in the SDK middleware documentation.
