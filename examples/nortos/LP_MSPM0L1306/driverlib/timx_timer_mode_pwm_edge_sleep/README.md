### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
TimerG0 will output a pair of 62.5Hz edge aligned PWM signals on PA12 and PA13.
PA12 is configured at a 75% duty cycle.
PA13 is configured at a 50% duty cycle.
Monitor the PWM signals on PA12 and PA13.
