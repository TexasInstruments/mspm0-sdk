## Example Summary

The following example configures ADC0 to trigger single conversion by software
and turn on LED1 if ADC > 0.5*(external vref). Otherwise, LED1 remains off.

This examples configure ADC12 instance to use internal voltage reference.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Provide a valid voltage to ADC0_0 (Voltage
source for ADC is excepted to be between 0 - External Vref (external reference
shouldn't exceed VDD) and monitor LED1. LED1 will be turned on when ADC
conversion greater than (External Vref / 2).

On powerup, the ADC and VREF pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
