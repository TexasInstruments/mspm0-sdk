## Example Summary

OPA is configured in general purpose mode with rail-to-rail configuration
enabled by default.
The inputs and output are configured for easy connection to external circuitry.

| PA16 | OPA1 | OUT | J3_24 | RC Filter R19/C10 not soldered by default |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | J2_13 | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | J2_17 | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869).

## Example Usage

Connect OPA1_IN1+ and OPA1_IN1- to external circuitry.
Compile, load and run the example.
OPA1_OUT will be the output of the Op-Amp.
