## Example Summary

The following example configures TIMG4 to output a single edge aligned PWM
signal with a continuously updating duty cycle using the shadow load feature. This 
generates a sine wave output after being filtered. 
The device is configured to wait in SLEEP mode.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1117 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau953).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
TIMA0 will output a PWM signal that continuously updates its duty cycle. 
Filter the PWM output and use an oscilloscope or similar device to see a sine wave output.
