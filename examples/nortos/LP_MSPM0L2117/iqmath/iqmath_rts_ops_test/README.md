## Example Summary
The following example goes through a set of IQmath operations to showcase the functionality of the module. For this example, we are using the RTS implementation of IQmath.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2117 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slvudf0).

## Example Usage
Compile and load the example.
Step through the example and examine the value of result variable (res) as described in the code example.
