 *  # Overview
 *
 *  MSPM0 support EEPROM emulation through its internal Flash. Compared to using
 *  an external serial EEPROM, EEPROM emulation using the internal Flash saves
 *  pin usage and cost.
 *  The EEPROM emulation Type A solution is suitable if the user application
 *  needs to store large "blocks" of data.
