## Example Summary

The following example configures ADC0 to trigger sequence of conversions on 4 different channels and stores the results in 4 different buffer arrays.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM02117 User's Guide.

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example. Connect vaild inputs ranging from 0-VCC to the ADC channels, floating pins are not guaranteed to read as 0.
