## Example Summary

The Flash Controller executes flash word (64-bit) programming with automatic hardware generated ECC as well as with manually provided ECC.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM0L2117 User's Guide.

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
The flash operations will start automatically when the example is run.
The application will stop at breakpoints so the user can verify the values in memory match those expected in the comments.
LED1 will begin toggling to signal example is complete. USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin.
