| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J27_9 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J4 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J19 1:2 3.3V Pull-up<br>J19 2:3 5V Pull-up |
| PA10 | I2C0 | SDA | J4_34/J26_5 | J21 2:3 Connect to J4_34<br>R62 connects J26_5 (default) |
| PA11 | I2C0 | SCL | J4_33/J26_6 | J22 2:3 Connect to J4_33<br>R63 connects J26_6 (default) |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example on an LP-MSPM0G3507.

Connect SCL and SDA to the corresponding SCL and SDA pins on the PMBus target.

Each command is sent to target one-by-one. Check response using logic analyzer or set breakpoints to debug.
