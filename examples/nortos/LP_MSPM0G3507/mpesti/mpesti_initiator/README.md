## Example Summary

This example transmits a UART packet as the switch S1 and S2 are being pressed.

LED toggles for each button press.
UART is configured at 250000bps.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
By default the jumpers are set to use the back-channel UART. Update the jumpers
to connect J21 pin 2 and J22 pin 2. This will short the RX and TX to create single wire UART connection.
Connect a wire from the jumper between J21 and J22 to the M-PESTI initiator circuit.
LED will toggle periodically when any of the switch is pressed.
The switch S1 toggles the command between DPR and boardcast.
The switch S2 will send the VWE command.
