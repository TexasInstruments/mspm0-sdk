### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage

By default the jumpers are set to use the back-channel UART. Update the jumpers to connect J21 pin 2 and J22 pin 2. This will short the RX and TX to create single wire UART connection.
Connect a wire from the jumper between J21 and J22 to the M-PESTI target circuit.
The RED led will toggle when the M-PESTI target receives the DPR request and is in DPR state.
The BLUE led will toggle when the M-PESTI target receives the VWE request and is in VWE state.
The GREEN led will toggle when the M-PESTI target receives the broadcast command.
