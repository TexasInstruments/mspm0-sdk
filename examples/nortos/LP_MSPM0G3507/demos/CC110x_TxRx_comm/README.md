## Example Summary

This example shows how to implement using MSPM0 to transmit/receive data to/from a CC110x device. It uses SPI communication and GPIO signals to communicate from one CC110X device to another CC110X device. The boards used for this example are the [EM Adapter Boosterpack](https://www.ti.com/tool/BOOST-CCEMADAPTER) and the [CC1101EM](https://www.ti.com/tool/CC1101-CC1190EM869RD).

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect the CC1101EM to the EM Adapter Boosterpack (positioned so both EMs' labels can be read from the same angle), then connect the EM Adapter Boosterpack to the LP-MSPM0G3507. The connections with the MSPM0 device are as follows:
    SPI SCLK  --> LP1_7
    SPI_PICO  --> LP2_6
    SPI_POCI  --> LP2_7
    GPIO_CSn  --> LP2_3 
    GPIO_GDO0 --> LP2_2
To transmit data from the MSPMM0 to another CC110X, exclude the rfPacketRx.c from the project, run the project, press the S2 button to transmit the data, and press again to stop sending data. The LED should toggle when transmitting, and stop toggling when not. To receive data from another CC110X device, exclude the rfPacketTx.c from a project and run the project. If data is received correctly, the LED should toggle.
