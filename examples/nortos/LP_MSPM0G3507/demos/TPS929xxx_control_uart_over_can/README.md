## Example Summary

This example shows the implementation of using MSPM0 to control TPS929240 to control multi-channel LEDs. After pressing the button connected to PB21 S2 on Launchpad, MSPM0 will start to control TPS929240 to change different patterns.

The example uses a TPS929240 which is a 24-channel, 40V high-side LED driver that controls the 8-bit output current and 12-bit PWM duty cycles. Please refer to [TPS929xxx LED Driver Control Using MSPM0 Through UART Over Can](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slaael6) app note for more details.

### Device Migration Recommendations

This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations

TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.

Please refer to [TPS929xxx LED Driver Control Using MSPM0 Through UART Over Can](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slaael6) app note for more details.
