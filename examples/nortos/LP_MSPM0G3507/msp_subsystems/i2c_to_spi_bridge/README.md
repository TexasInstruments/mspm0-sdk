## Example Summary

The following example bridges incoming I2C transmissions to an SPI peripheral. The SPI is configured for 1MHz transmissions. The bridge receives data from the I2C input, sends that data through SPI, gets data from an SPI target, and then waits for an I2C Controller to request the data in the bridge. For more information, please read this project's subsystem design(https://www.ti.com/lit/sd/slaaes6/slaaes6.pdf).

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect SDA and SCL between the I2C Controller and the Bridge's I2C Target (remember to use pull-up resistors). Attach the SPI peripheral to the Bridge's SPI Controller. Compile, load, and run the example. After receiving an I2C message, the bridge translates it to SPI. Connect a logic analyzer in the I2C lines and SPI lines or check the buffer (gI2CRxPacket, gSPITxPacket, gSPIRxData) values after a transaction to verify the message is being sent correctly.
