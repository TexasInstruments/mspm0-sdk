## Example Summary
This example demonstrates how to simultaneously sample 2 signals with 2 ADCs use the DMA to extract the results.
The ADCs are using 12-bit resolution mode with a 10us sampling time and using the Internal Vref at 2.5V as the reference voltage.
The example starts a Timer instance with a 500ms period that publishes to a 1:2 [#Publishers : #Subscribers] channel in the Event Manager on a zero event. The ADCs subscribe to this channel and begin their burst when the Timer triggers.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Input a signal within 0 - 2.5V into both ADC inputs. 
Inspect the buffers at the software breakpoint, the values of which will be updated on every continue of the program.
