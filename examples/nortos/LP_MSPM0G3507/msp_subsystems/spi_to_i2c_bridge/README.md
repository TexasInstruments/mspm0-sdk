## Example Summary
The following example bridges incoming SPI transmissions to an I2C peripheral. The I2C is configured for 100kHz transmissions. The bridge receives data from the SPI input, sends that data through I2C, gets data from an I2C target, and then waits for an SPI controller to request the data in the bridge. For more information, please read this project's Subsystem design (https://www.ti.com/lit/sd/slaaes5/slaaes5.pdf).

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect the SPI Controller to the Bridge's SPI Peripheral. Attach the SDA and SCL between the Bridge's I2C Controller to the I2C target (remember to use pull-up resistors). Compile, load, and run the example. After receiving an SPI message, the bridge translates it to I2C. Connect a logic analyzer in the SPI lines and I2C
lines or check the buffer (gSPIRxData, gI2CTxData, gI2CRxData, gSPITxData) values after a transaction to verify the message is being sent correctly.
