### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
The device CAN_RX and CAN_TX are to be connected to a CAN transceiver which will route the lines to the CAN Bus.

Make the following connections, which can Invoke BSL through GPIO togggling,
- Controller NRST -> Peripheral NRST
- Controller BSL Invoke -> Peripheral BSL Invoke.

Compile, load and run the example.
Set up Initial CAN configurations as
    * CAN Mode : Classical CAN (BRS disabled)
    * Nominal Speed : 1 Mbps
    * Sampling point : 87.5
Push the S2 button to start program MSPM0G3507.
Note: if use software trigger need the application code(include software invoke) exist on the chip. 
# Note
* * The Example is configured to work in CAN mode initially at 1 Mbps to get response from CAN plugin.
* To change the bitrate of communication based on the configuration obtained from host through Change Baudrate Command
    * The Data section in Change Baudrate Command is expected to match the format shown below

|     Padding      (5)    |     DRP      (5)    |     DSJW     (4)    |     DTSEG2      (4)    |     DTSEG1      (5)    |     NRP      (9)    |     NSJW      (7)    |     NSEG2      (7)    |     NTSEG1      (8)    |     BRS      (1)    |     FD      (1)    |
|------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|

* An arbitrary CAN frame is injected into CAN bus, on changing the CAN Mode to CAN FD to calibrate the transmission delay compensation attribute values. The Identity value can be modified as required.
* Message Identifier accepted by BSL CAN Host is 0x004
* Message Identifier sent from BSL CAN HOST to BSL CAN PLUGIN is 0x003
