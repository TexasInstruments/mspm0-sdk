## Example Summary
This example demonstrates how to publish and subscribe events between GPIOA and
GPIOB instances without CPU intervention.

GPIOB instance publishes events via USER_SWITCH_1 to GPIO_EVENT_CHANNEL. GPIOA
is subscribed to GPIO_EVENT_CHANNEL and is configured to toggle
USER_LED_1 every time a rising or falling edge is detected on USER_SWITCH_1.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

| Peripheral | Pin | Function |

| GPIOA | PA0 | Open-Drain Output |
| GPIOB | PB21 | Standard Input with internal pull-up |
| SYSCTL |  |  |
| EVENT |  |  |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In Out |

| Pin | Peripheral | Function | LaunchPad Pin | LaunchPad Settings |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PA0 | GPIOA | PA0 | J27_9 | This pin is 5V tolerant open-drain and requires pull-up.<br>J4 ON/OFF: Connect/Disconnect LED1<br>J19 1:2 3.3V Pull-up<br>J19 2:3 5V Pull-up |
| PB21 | GPIOB | PB21 | J27_4 | Connected to S2 button (no pull resistor) |
| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. LED1 toggles every time a rising or falling
edge is detected on S2.
