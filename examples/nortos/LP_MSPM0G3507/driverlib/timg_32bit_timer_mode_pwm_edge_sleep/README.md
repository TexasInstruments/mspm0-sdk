## Example Summary

The following example configures a 32-bit TimerG to output a pair of edge aligned PWM
signals. The device is configured to wait in SLEEP mode.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
The 32-bit timer will output a pair of 62.5Hz edge aligned PWM signals with
duty cycles of 75% and 50% respectively.
