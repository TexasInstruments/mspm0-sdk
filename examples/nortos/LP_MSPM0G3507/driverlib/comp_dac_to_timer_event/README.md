## Example Summary

COMP is configured using the 8-bit DAC as positive input, and the external pin
as negative input. The DAC is set to 1V using VDDA as reference.
The output of the comparator triggers a timer event. The timer is configured in
Edge Time Capture mode with a capture window of 1sec.
At the end of the window, a breakpoint is triggered to check the number of
detected captures.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Connect COMP0_IN0- to an external signal.
Compile, load and run the example.
A breakpoint will be triggered after 1sec. Use the debugger to check the number
of captures and the timing of each capture.

On powerup, the COMP pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
