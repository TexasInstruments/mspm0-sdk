## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerA to output a single PWM signal and update
the signal’s frequency and duty cycle by using the shadow load and shadow capture
compare feature. Shadow load will only update the timer load values on a zero event
and the shadow capture compare value (which controls the PWM duty cycle) update
is configured to update when the timer reaches a count of zero.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Monitor the PWM signal on PB26.
