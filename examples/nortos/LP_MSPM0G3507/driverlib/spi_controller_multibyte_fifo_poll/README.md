## Example Summary

Note: The use of "Master" and "Slave", along with "MOSI/MISO" terminology is being considered obsolete. These terms will be replaced with "Controller" and "Peripheral", and "PICO/POCI" respectively.

The following example configures the SPI as a Controller.
This example can be used with the spi_peripheral_multibyte_fifo_poll example running on another device.
This example fills the TX FIFO with 4 bytes of data and transmits it to the SPI Peripheral.
It then waits to receive 4 bytes of data from the Peripheral to fill up the RX FIFO.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
Make the following connections between the SPI Controller and SPI Peripheral:
- Controller SCLK -> Peripheral SCLK
- Controller PICO -> Peripheral PICO
- Controller POCI <- Peripheral POCI
- Controller CS   -> Peripheral CS

Compile, load and run the example. The SPI will automatically start
to transmit and receive data.

The SPI is initialized with the following configuration:
- SPI Controller
- Motorola 4 Wire with Polarity 0, Phase 0
- No parity
- 8 bits per transfer
- MSB first
