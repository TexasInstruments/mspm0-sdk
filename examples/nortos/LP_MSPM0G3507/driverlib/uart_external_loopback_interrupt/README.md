## Example Summary

The following example configures the UART at 9600bps to transmit and receive
data. The device should be configured in external loopback mode.
The device remains in SLEEP mode while waiting for an interrupt.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau846).

## Example Usage
To use this application in external loopback mode, place a jumper between PA11
(UART0_RX) and PA10 (UART0_TX).
Compile, load and run the example.
Through the external loopback, the UART will automatically start to transmit
and receive from itself.
