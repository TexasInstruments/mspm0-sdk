## Example Summary

This example implements a UART controller using the MSP Communication modules - UART. This example demonstrates sending commands to a UART Target to read from or write to its memory address and shows the response.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage
Connect UART Rx and Tx of Controller to UART Tx and Rx of Target respectively. Compile, load and run the example.

Send command to Target by setting gSendCommand as true and check response through gResponse from expressions.

Please refer to MSPM0 Communication Modules - UART User Guide for more details.
