## Example Summary

The following example configures the ADC0 to trigger single conversion and send the ADC data through UART.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3519 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3519 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau947).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Provide a valid voltage to the ADC input between 0 - VCC.
Scope PA10 for the UART TX signal and see the ADC code, high byte then low byte.
