## Example Summary
This example demonstrate how to capture 1024 samples of a single ADC
channel using 8-bit ADC resolution mode at maximum sampling rate. A DMA
transfer is triggered every time a new result is loaded to ADC conversion memory
and will continue the transfer until 1024 samples are loaded to gADCSamples
array. Once 1024 samples are captured the ADC12 module generates a DMA done
interrupt.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM0G3519 User's Guide.

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Once the DMA done interrupt is triggered, the
example code will hit the break point instruction and gADCSamples array
can be inspected.
