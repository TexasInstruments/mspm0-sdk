## Example Summary

This example demonstrates an application request to reset the device and jump to
the Flash bootloader (BSL).

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0C1106 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#manual-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1106 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau950).

## Example Usage
This demo's firmware is used for the BSL host device. 

The example will begin toggling LED1 while waiting for the user to press
the S2 button or send 0x22 from host to trigger BSL.

When S2 is pressed or 0x22 received, the application will:
1. Clear Blue LED1
2. Blink Green LED2
3. Reset the device with BOOTLOADERENTRY reset level

This will run the bootcode, which will:
- Check if there is a BSL request from the application
- Invoke the BSL if the bootloader is enabled in nonmain
- At this point, both LED1 and LED2 will be off

Once the BSL has been invoked, the user can send commands to the BSL through the
external BSL Host.

To return to application code, the user can either:
- Trigger a POR/BOR on the device
- Use the BSL Host to send the application start command to the device
