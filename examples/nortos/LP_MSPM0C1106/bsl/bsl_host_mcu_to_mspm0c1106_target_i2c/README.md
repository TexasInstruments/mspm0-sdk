## Example Summary

This demo shows how to program a MSPM0C1106 MCU using a LP-MSPM0C1106 as host by BSL I2C interface.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0C1106 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1106 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau950).

## Example Usage

Connect the hardware as described in the document. Compile, load and run the example.
Push the S2 button to start BSL to program MSPM0C1106.

> **Note:** To use software trigger mode, you need to ensure that the application code (`bsl_software_invoke_app_demo`) exists on the target and the global define of `Software_Invoke` is enabled in the project.
