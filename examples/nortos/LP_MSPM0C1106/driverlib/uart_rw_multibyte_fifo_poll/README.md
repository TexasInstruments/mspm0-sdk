## Example Summary

This example transmits a UART packet, and then waits to receive UART data.
This example uses FIFOs with polling. It can only handle a maximum of 8 bytes
due to FIFO size.
LED toggles if transmission and reception are successful.
UART is configured at 9600bps.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM0C1106 User's Guide.

## Example Usage
By default the jumpers are set to use the back-channel UART. Update the jumpers
to connect RX and TX between two UART devices.
LED will toggle periodically if transmission and reception were successful.
LED will remain off if there is a problem during initialization.
LED will remain on if there is a problem during data transfers.
USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin on the BoosterPack
header and can be used to verify the LED behavior.
