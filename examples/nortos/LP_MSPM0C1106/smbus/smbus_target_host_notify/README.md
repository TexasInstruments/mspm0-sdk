## Example Summary

This example shows the implementation of SMBus Host Notify protocol for a
target device using the MSPM0 SMBus software library.
The target device will respond to WRITE_BYTE command 0x12 toggling the LED
depending on the data, and it will send a Host Notify command when a button is 
pressed.
This target example is intended to be used with the controller example 
smbus_controller_host_notify.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0C1106 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0C1106 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0C1106).

## Example Usage

Connect SMBCLK (SCL), SMBDAT (SDA) and GND to the corresponding pins on a second
MSPM0 LaunchPad running the smbus_controller_host_notify example.
Note that I2C requires pull-up resistors. Internal pull-ups can be enabled in
SysConfig (see datasheet for resistance specification), but external pull-ups
might be required based on I2C speed and capacitance. External pull-ups can be
connected or enabled using the LaunchPad.

Compile, load and run the example.

The target example waits for command 0x12 from the SMBus controller and 
processes it. It will clear the LED if data is 0x00, otherwise the LED will be 
set.

The target example will also send a Host Notify command sending an incrementing
counter when a button is pressed.
Optionally, an I2C sniffer can be used to observe the SMBus protocol.
