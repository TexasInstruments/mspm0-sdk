## Example Summary

This example demonstrates a motor fault detection application using an AI model on MSPM0G5187 microcontroller. The system collects vibration data from an ADXL355 accelerometer, extracts frequency-domain features using FFT, and performs inference using a pre-trained neural network model. The detected fault class is indicated by toggling onboard LEDs.

In this example the inference happens using the M0+ CPU itself and not hardware accelerator is used.

The class to LED color mapping is shown below:
   - **Blue**: Class 0 (Normal)
   - **Red**: Class 1 (Blade Damage)
   - **Green**: Class 2 (Blade Imbalance)
   - **White**: Class 3 (others or unknown)

### Low-Power Recommendations

Terminate unused pins by configuring them as GPIO outputs low or inputs with 
internal pull-up/pull-down resistors. Use SysConfig to easily configure unused pins.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

## Example Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Connect the ADXL355 accelerometer (SPI Peripheral) to the MSPM0 SPI interface (SPI Controller).
     - Controller SCLK -> Peripheral SCLK
     - Controller PICO -> Peripheral PICO
     - Controller POCI <- Peripheral POCI
     - Controller CS   -> Peripheral CS
   - Connect the sensor ready pin (Data Ready - DRDY) to the designated GPIO interrupt pin (PA12).
     - DRDY -> Standard Input
   - Ensure LEDs are connected to the appropriate GPIO pins for class indication.
   - Ensure that the digital ground and power from the microntroller is connected to respective pins on the sensor.
   - Stick the sensor to the top of the motor.

2. **Operation**
   - On startup, the application initializes the sensor and peripherals.
   - The ADXL355 accelerometer collects vibration data from the motor.
   - When new data is ready, an interrupt triggers data acquisition.
   - The application performs feature extraction using FFT and bins the frequency magnitudes.
   - Extracted features are fed to the AI model for inference.
   - The output class (fault type) is determined and stored in a circular buffer.
   - The LED corresponding to the most frequently detected class in the buffer is toggled:
     - **LED1 (Blue)**: Class 0 (Normal)
     - **LED2 (Red)**: Class 1 (Blade Damage)
     - **LED3 (Green)**: Class 2 (Blade Imbalance)
     - **All LEDs (White)**: Class 3 (others or unknown)

3. **Running the Example**
   - Compile, load, and run the application on your MSPM0 device.
   - The system will continuously monitor motor vibration and indicate detected fault classes via LEDs.

## Software Details

- **Feature Extraction**: Uses ARM CMSIS-DSP library for real FFT and magnitude calculation.
- **AI Inference**: Runs a pre-trained model using TVM runtime.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Efficient data collection via GPIO interrupts.
- **LED Indication**: Fault class is indicated by toggling onboard LEDs.
- **AI model used**: Model details find in tensor lab repo.

## Notes

- Ensure the ADXL355 sensor is properly powered and connected.
- Adjust LED and GPIO pin assignments as needed for your hardware.
