## Example Summary

This example implements a UART Target using the MSP Communication modules - UART. This example illustrates responding to read or write commands sent by a UART Controller.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G5187 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

## Example Usage
Connect UART Rx and Tx of Controller to UART Tx and Rx of Target respectively. Compile, load and run the example.

Please refer to MSPM0 Communication Modules - UART User Guide for more details.
