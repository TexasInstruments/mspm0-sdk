## Example Summary

The following example configures TimerG6 in edge count mode to detect a
predefined number of rising edges.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G5187 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau967).

## Example Usage
Connect to PB6 (GPIO_TIMER_CAPTURE_C0_PIN) to an edge generator source (it can
also be connected to a momentary switch).
Compile, load and run the example.
LED1 will toggle every time TIMG6 detects 5 edges.
USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin on the BoosterPack
header and can be used to verify the LED behavior.
