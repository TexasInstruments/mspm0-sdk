### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0H3216 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

<!-- For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1306 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau869). -->

## Example Usage

The SENT transmit example is configured to run at 32MHz. These settings
can be modified in the application.

The example configures the device to operate in SENT transmitter mode using the following configuration:

~~~
  tickDuration            = 3;
  pauseConfig.mode        = SENT_PAUSE_MODE_FIXED_FRAME;
  pauseConfig.numOfTicks  = 500;
  numDataNibbles          = SENT_NUM_DATA_NIBBLES_6;
~~~

Two SENT frames are preconfigured and toggled every 1.5 ms (500 ticks)

The example can be configured in the following ways:
- SENT_PACK struct
    - status: 1 status nibble
    - d0 - d5: 6 data nibbles
    - crc: 1 crc nibble
    - pause: pause pulse value

- SENT_config_obj struct
    - tickDuration: number of us per tick (between 1-90 us)
    - pauseConfig: pause configuration struct
    - numDataNibbles: number of data nibbles (configured to 6 by default)

- SENT_PAUSE struct
    - mode: mode for pause pulse configuration
    - number of ticks for pause pulse or frame (depending on configuration)

- SENT_Handler struct
    - *pPeriodTable: look-up table with tick count values per nibble
    - tickDuration: number of us per tick (between 1-90 us)
    - pauseConfig: pause config struct
    - syncCount: timer count for SYNC pulse
    - lowTimeCount: timer count for low ticks of each pulse
    - *pCurrentSentPack: pointer to current SENT packet
    - *pNextSentPack: pointer to next SENT packet
    - numOfNibbles: number of nibbles in data packet (configured to 6 by default)
    - sentState: current state of SENT packet
    - updatePack: flag for when to update pointer to packet


Configuration is done in sent_transmit.c.

Compile, load and run the example.

LED1 will turn on when the SENT packet transfer starts and two alternating fixed frame SENT packets will output on PA6.

The output on PA6 can be connected to the RX of a SENT bus along with a connection between the LaunchPad GND and the SENT bus GND.
