## Example Summary

The following example configures the ADC to trigger single conversion in repeat
mode to monitor internal channel to monitor voltage supply and turn on
an LED if VCC > 2.5V. Otherwise, the LED remains off.

## Peripherals & Pin Assignments

| Peripheral | Pin | Function |

| GPIOA | PA0 | Open-Drain Output |
| SYSCTL |  |  |
| ADC0 |  |  |
| VREF |  |  |
| EVENT |  |  |
| DEBUGSS | PA20 | Debug Clock |
| DEBUGSS | PA19 | Debug Data In Out |

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the MSPM0 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the LP-MSPM0H3216 User's Guide.

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Vary MCU voltage supply to go below 2.5V and monitor the LED.
