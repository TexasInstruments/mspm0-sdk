## Example Summary

#### MSP-DALI LED Demo
This example shows how to utilize Parts 102 and 207 from MSP DALI Library to create a simple LED Demo.  This demo allows you to utilize the various DALI commands to control an LED on the launchpad and keep track of pertinent DALI
information.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0H3216 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.


## Example Usage

After connecting the TIDA 010-963 Boosterpack to the LP_MSPM0H3216, connect pin PA10 to J2_12 Pin on boosterpack, which maps to PA7 on the launchpad.
Compile, load and run the example.

Please refer to MSPM0 DALI User's Guide for more details.
