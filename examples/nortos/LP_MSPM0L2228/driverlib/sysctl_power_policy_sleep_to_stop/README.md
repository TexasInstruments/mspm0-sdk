## Example Summary

The following example explains how to change the power policy from SLEEP0
to STOP0 during runtime. There are two timers in use: TIMG0 and TIMG1.
TIMG1 is sourced from the SYSOSC, and can run in SLEEP but not STOP.
TIMG0 is sourced from MFCLK.
The application will start in SLEEP0, and then every 5s the power policy will
switch to STOP0. The power policies will continue to alternate every 5s.
TIMG1 will toggle LED1 every 250ms during the SLEEP policy, and then toggle
every 2s while the device is in STOP.
TIMG0 will toggle the LED2 constantly every 5000ms during both SLEEP and
STOP.

**Note**: When debugging the application, the power access port (PWR-AP) will force
the device to remain active. In order to see full functionality of this example, it is
recommended to terminate the debug session. Refer to the Debug section of the TRM
for more information about debugging in low power modes.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example.
Monitor the behavior of LED1 and LED2.
LED1 will toggle for 5 seconds while the device is in SLEEP0, and and then
toggle every 2s while the device is in STOP.
LED0 will continue to toggle every 500ms.

## Important Note
Early experimental samples have a known issue where the user is unable to
reconnect their debugger connection after the device has gone into STOP or
STANDBY mode. Please review advisory DEBUGSS_02 to see the steps to regain
the ability to connect the device to the debugger. This information is located
in the "MSPM0G and MSPM0L Families: Functional Differences With Early Samples"
document.
