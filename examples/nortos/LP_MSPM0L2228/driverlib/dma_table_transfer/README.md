## Example Summary

DMA example with a table distributed to SRAM memory via DMA, triggered by SW.

DMA channel 0 is setup as a software triggered transfer. Upon request, the DMA
distributes a series of data from a address/data table to SRAM memory. Data
transfer is confirmed by status of boolean gVerifyResult before executing a WFI.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage
Compile, load and run the example. Inspect gVerifyResult via a debugger once example
hits the software breakpoint.
