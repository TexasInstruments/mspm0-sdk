## Example Summary

I2C Controller writes and reads multiple bytes to/from a target device.
The example uses FIFO and interrupts.
LED toggles if transmission and reception are successful.
The Target device must be enabled and active before running this example.

This example can be used to validate I2C communication, as a starting point to
control any I2C target, or to create custom drivers.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage

Connect SDA and SCL between I2C Controller and Target.
Compile, load and run the example.
LED2.Red will toggle periodically if transmission and reception were successful.
LED2.Red will remain off if there is a problem during initialization.
LED2.Red will remain on if there is a problem during data transfers.
