## Example Summary

The following example used keystore for secure storage of key and performs 256-bit AES CMAC encryption using the on-board AESADV engine with a software wrapper.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#manual-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage
As we are loading non-main with csc enabled configuration give BOR(boot reset) after loading application file.
Then Compile, load and run the example.

The application will hit a SW breakpoint to allow the user to inspect the value of gCorrectResults and gSuccessfulOperation to see if the AES operation completed successfully. gAesTagOut will have the value generated tag.
