## Example Summary

COMP is configured in high-speed mode using the 8-bit DAC with external
reference as the positive input, and the external pin as negative input.
An interrupt is triggered when the external input crosses the DAC treshold and
a LED is toggled accordingly.
The COMP hysteresis and filter are used to prevent multiple interrupt firing
immediately.
The device stays in SLEEP mode, except when an interrupt is fired.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage

Connect COMP0_IN0- to an external signal.
Connect external reference to VREF+.
Compile, load and run the example.
Check LED toggle when the external input crosses 1V. The example sets the DAC
threshold expecting a VREF of 3V.

On powerup, the COMP and VREF pin(s) used in this example are by default set to
the correct analog mode. Therefore, calls to
DL_GPIO_initPeripheralAnalogFunction for pinmuxing those pins are not needed.
