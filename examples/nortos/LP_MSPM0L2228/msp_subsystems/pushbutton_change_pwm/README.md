## Example Summary

This example demonstrates using the two switches on the MSPM0G3507 Launchpad to change the period and duty cycle on TIMG4 PWM output channels CC0 and CC1. Pressing switch S1 changes the PWM period of the timer. Pressing S2 changes the duty cycle on CC1 output. This example also demonstrates the use of TIMA0 configured as a one-shot timer and interrupts for debouncing the switches.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L2228 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**→**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L2228 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L2228).

## Example Usage
Compile, load, and run the example. At startup, TIMA1 is loaded with a PWM period of 1ms (1000Hz) and 75% duty cycle on CC0 and 25% duty cycle on CC1.  Pressing switch S1 will cycle through the following PWM periods: 1ms, 2ms, 4ms, and 0.5ms.    These changes are reflected on both CC0 and CC1 outputs. Pressing switch S2 will cycle through the following PWM duty cycles: 75%, 90%, 25%, and 50%
