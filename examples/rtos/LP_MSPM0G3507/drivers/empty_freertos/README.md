| PA20 | DEBUGSS | SWCLK | N/A | J101 15:16 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWCLK (debug) |
| PA19 | DEBUGSS | SWDIO | N/A | J101 13:14 ON: Connect to XDS-110 SWDIO (debug) |

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0G3507).


### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#non-sysconfig-compatible-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

## Example Usage

* The example lights `CONFIG_GPIO_LED_0` as part of the initialization in the
`mainThread()`. This thread then toggles the LED at a 1 second rate.

## Application Design Details

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
