### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1117 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L1117).


### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#non-sysconfig-compatible-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
Connect to terminal if using Launchpad's back-channel UART, or connect to
external device using BoosterPack.
The UART will wait to receive data and respond with echo.

## Application Design Details

* This example shows how to initialize the UART0 driver in blocking read and write mode and echo characters back to a console.
* A single thread, mainThread, reads a character from CONFIG_UART_0 and writes it back.

### FREERTOS:

* Please view the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file for example configuration information.
