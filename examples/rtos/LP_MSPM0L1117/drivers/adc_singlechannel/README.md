### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1117 web page](https://www.ti.com/tool/LP-MSPM0L1117).


### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#non-sysconfig-compatible-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

## Example Usage

* Example output is generated through use of Display driver APIs.

* Connect the ADC channels to the sampling sources.
    * For quick testing, connect ADC channel pin to `GND` and run the test, then connect to `3V3` and run the test.

>__Important:__ Caution should be used when connecting the pins to analog inputs greater than 3VDC.

* Open a serial session (e.g. [`PuTTY`](http://www.putty.org/ "PuTTY's
Homepage"), etc.) to the appropriate COM port.
* The COM port can be determined via Device Manager in Windows or via
`ls /dev/tty*` in Linux.

* The connection will have the following settings:

```text
    Baud-rate:     115200
    Data bits:          8
    Stop bits:          1
    Parity:          None
    Flow Control:    None
```

* Run the example.

* Example snippet of outputs:

```text
        Starting the adcsinglechannel example

        CONFIG_ADC_0 raw result (0): 4095

        CONFIG_ADC_0 convert result (0): 3300000 uV

        CONFIG_ADC_0 raw result (1): 4095

        CONFIG_ADC_0 convert result (1): 3300000 uV
                    .                 .     .
                    .                 .     .
                    .                 .     .
        CONFIG_ADC_0 raw result (9): 4095

        CONFIG_ADC_0 convert result (9): 3300000 uV
```

* The example outputs ten samples from `CONFIG_ADC_0`.

* The actual conversion result values may vary depending on the reference
voltage settings. Please refer to the board specific datasheet for more details.

## Application Design Details

This application uses a single thread:

`threadFxn0` - performs the following actions:

1. Opens an ADC driver object.

2. Uses the ADC driver object to perform 10 samples and output the results.

3. Closes the ADC driver object.

FreeRTOS:

* Please view the `FreeRTOSConfig.h` header file for example configuration
information.
