## Example Summary

The POSIX demo implements a blinking LED with POSIX thread where the
LED blinks every 1 second.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0L1117 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#manual-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
TI recommends to terminate unused pins by setting the corresponding functions to
GPIO and configure the pins to output low or input with internal
pullup/pulldown resistor.

SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0L1117 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage

Compile, load and run the example.
LED1 will blink every 1s.

## Application Design Details

* This example uses POSIX API functions to create a task.
* A single Thread is used to blink LED1 with a delay of 1s.

### FREERTOS:

* Please view the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file for example configuration information.
