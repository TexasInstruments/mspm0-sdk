# Summary #
The MSPM0 SDK provides the ultimate collection of software, tools and documentation to accelerate the development of applications for the MSPM0 MCU platform. The software is designed for optimal performance and memory utilization, providing a consistent and cohesive experience with a wide variety of drivers, libraries and easy-to-use examples under a single software package

# Features #
Support for the ARM®Cortex®-M0+ core and all MSPM0 devices with full support of their corresponding EVMs and peripherals.
A wide variety of middleWare including drivers, libraries and protocol stacks for different applications and sectors including automotive, appliances, building and factory automation, etc.
An extensive list of ready-to-use code examples to demonstrate and test device functionality, and provide a starting point to accelerate application development

# Background #
This repository contains all the files located in TI's MSPM0 SDK [installer](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSPM0-SDK). It is provided via a Git repo to meet several use cases, including:
* Enables CI/CD tooling to use Git rather than installers
* Increases visibility of changes, better enabling benefit/risk assessments
* Simplifies the workflow for rebasing user changes to different releases

# Documentation #
