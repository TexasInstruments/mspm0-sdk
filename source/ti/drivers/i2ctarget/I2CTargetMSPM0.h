 *
 *  @brief      I2CTarget driver implementation for a MSPM0 device I2C
 *              target.
 *
 *  @defgroup   I2CTargetMSPM0 I2C driver APIs
 *
 *  @note       All calls should go through the generic I2CTarget API.
 *
 *  # Driver Include #
 *  The I2CTarget header file should be included in an application as follows:
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/drivers/I2CTarget.h>
 *  #include <ti/drivers/i2c/I2CTargetMSPM0.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Refer to @ref I2CTarget.h for a complete description of APIs.
 *
 *  # Overview
 *  The generic I2CTarget API is normally used in application code,
 *  for example, @ref I2CTarget_open(). Do not use APIs in this header file
 *  directly. The board file will define the device specific config, and casting
 *  in the general API will ensure that the correct device specific functions
 *  are called.
 *
 *  ## General Behavior
 *  Before using the I2C in MSPM0:
 *   - The I2CTarget driver is initialized by calling I2CTarget_init().
 *   - The I2C HW is configured and system dependencies are declared (e.g. IOs,
 *     power, etc.) by calling I2CTarget_open().
 *   - The I2CTarget driver starts acting on I2C bus activities after calling
 *     @ref I2CTarget_start().
 *
 *  ## Power Management
 *  The Power drivers are yet to implement but the behavior should follow like the information given here.
 *  The I2CTargetMSPM0 driver sets a power constraint when @ref I2CTarget_start()
 *  is called to keep the device out of standby; so when all tasks are blocked, the device will
 *  enter idle mode instead of standby. When the application calls @ref I2CTarget_stop(), the
 *  the power constraint to prohibit standby is released.
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After I2CTarget_open() call: I2C peripheral is enabled in target mode, but the device can
 *      enter standby. The device will need to be woken up (for example on GPIO or timer events)
 *      before I2C bus activity can be processed.
 *    - After I2CTarget_start() call: I2C events will trigger the user callback function. The device
 *      might enter idle, but not standby.
 *    - After I2C_stop() call: Same as after I2CTarget_open() call.
 *    - After I2C_close() call: I2C peripheral is disabled.
 *
 * ## Supported Functions
 *  @note All calls should go through the generic API.
 *
 *  @anchor ti_drivers_I2CTARGETMSPM0_USE_CASES
 *  # Use Cases
 *  See generic API for examples.

 *  @brief  I2CTargetMSPM0 Hardware attributes
 *
 *  The baseAddr and intNum fields define the base address and the interrupt
 *  number of the I2C peripheral.  These values are passed to driverlib APIs
 *  and therefore must be populated by driverlib macro definitions.  These
 *  macros are found in the header files:
 *      - ti\devices\msp\peripherals\hw_i2c.h
 *
 *  The powerMngrId is the Power driver resource ID for the I2C peripheral.
 *  These macros are defined in the device specific Power include file.
 *
 *  intPriority is the I2C peripheral's interrupt priority, This value is passed
 *  unmodified to Hwi_create().
 *
 *  sdaPinMux and sclPinMux are values drawn from the GPIO driver. They indicate
 *  the function for that specific IO pin that select I2C mode.
