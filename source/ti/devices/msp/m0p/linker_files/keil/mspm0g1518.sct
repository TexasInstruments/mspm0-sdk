;* Note: SRAM on this device is continuous memory but partitioned in the 
;* linker into two separate sections. This is to account for the upper 64kB
;* of SRAM being wiped out upon the device entering any low-power mode 
;* stronger than SLEEP. Thus, it is up to the end-user to enable SRAM_BANK1 
;* for applications where the memory is considered lost outside of RUN 
;* and SLEEP Modes.
