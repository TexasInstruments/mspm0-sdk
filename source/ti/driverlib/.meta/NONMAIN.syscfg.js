    longDescription: `
The **Configuration NVM (NONMAIN) Configurator** assists the user in modifying the configuration
policies for the start-up boot routines by altering the values programmed into
the Configuration NVM flash region.

After a BOOTRST, the device always executes the start-up boot routines from
read-only memory (ROM) to configure the device for operation before starting
the main application. There are two boot routines: the **boot configuration
routine (BCR)**, and the **bootstrap loader (BSL)**.

The **BCR** sets up the device security policies, configures the device for
operation, and optionally starts the BSL.

The **BSL**, if started by the BCR, can be used to program and/or verify the
device memory (flash and SRAM) through the use of a standard serial
interface (UART or I2C).
