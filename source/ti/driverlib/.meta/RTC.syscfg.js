The **Real-Time Clock (RTC) module** provides time-keeping for the application,
with counters for seconds, minutes, hours, day of the week, day of the
month, and year.

Under *Alarm Configuration* users can
- Set up to 2 Calendar alarms based on settings contained in the alarm registers
- Set an Interval alarm on these conditions:
    - MIN changes
    - HOUR changes
    - Every day at midnight
    - Every day at noon
- Set up to 2 Periodic alarms to generate 2 periodic time bases for the application.

Check the datasheet of your selected device for more detailed information.
