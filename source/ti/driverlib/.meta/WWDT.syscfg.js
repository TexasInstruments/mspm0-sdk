    longDescription: `
The **Window Watchdog Timer (WWDT) module** is used to initiate a system
restart (SYSRST) when correct operation of the device has failed due to an
unexpected software or system delay.

Under *Basic Configuration* users can:
- Configure the clock source and frequency
- Configure window period settings
- Enable WWDT running during sleep

The WWDT module provides one interrupt source which can be configured to
source a CPU interrupt event. This interrupt indicates that the WWDT interval
timer period has expired.

Check the datasheet of your selected device for more detailed information.
