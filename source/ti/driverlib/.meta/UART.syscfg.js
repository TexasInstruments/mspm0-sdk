    description: "Template UART Module for MSPM0",
    longDescription: `
The **UART module** can be used to transfer data between a MSPM0 device and
another device with various serial asynchronous communication protocols.

Protocols supported:
- Local Interconnect Network (LIN) support
- DALI
- IrDA
- ISO7816 Smart card
- RS485
- Manchester coding
- Idle-Line Multiprocessor

Under *Basic Configuration* users can configure UART initialization parameters
such as clock source, baud rate, parity, etc.

Under *Advanced Configuration* users can:
- Choose a specific UART mode
- Configure other parameters such as:
    - Oversampling
    - Glitch filtering
    - RX Timeout interrupts
    - etc.
