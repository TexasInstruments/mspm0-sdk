    longDescription: `
The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AESADV) accelerator module** accelerator
module performs encryption and decryption of 128-bit data blocks with a 128-bit
or 256-bit key in hardware according to the advanced encryption standard
specified in FIPS PUB 197.

Under *Basic Configuration* users can:
- Configure AESADV key length
- Configure the operation type
- Configure cipher mode

Check the datasheet of your selected device for more detailed information.
