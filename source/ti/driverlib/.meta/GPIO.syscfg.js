    longDescription: `
The **GPIO module** enables and configures General Purpose I/O pins.

Under *Basic Configuration* users can:
- Put GPIO's into groups
- Configure digital IOMUX features
- Configure I/O based on Interrupts/Events
- Configure GPIO pins in low-power modes using FaskWake

Under *Advanced Configuration* users can configure glitch filters, clock
timeout detection, etc.

For *Global Pin Configuration,* see the Board module.
