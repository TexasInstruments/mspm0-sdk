    longDescription: `
The **SPI module** provides an interface for synchronous serial
communication with peripheral devices and other controllers.

Under *Basic Configuration* users can:
- Enable and configure SPI initialization parameters:
    - Mode select
    - Clock configuration
    - Frame configuration
    - Chip select

Under *Advanced Configuration* users can:
- Enable/configure parity mode
- Configure TX/RX FIFO thresholds
- Enable command data mode and/or internal loopback
- Configure sampling parameters
