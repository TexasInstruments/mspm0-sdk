    longDescription: `
The **SYSCTL (System Control) module** allows you to configure power and clocking
for your specific application.

Under *Power & Systems Configuration* users can:
- Specify what power policy the device will use
- Set BOR threshold
- Enable/Disable:
    - Write lock
    - Sleep on exit
    - processor wakeup on pending events
    - NRST pin functionality
- Enable and configure frequency clock counter (FCC)
- Enable FlashCtl and power/system interrupts

Under *Clock Configuration* users can:
- Configure clocks:
    - Main Clock (MCLK)
    - Middle Frequency Clock (MFCLK)
    - Low Frequency Clock (LFCLK)
    - Middle Frequency Precision Clock (MFPCLK)
    - Low Power Clock (ULPCLK)
    - High Frequency Clock (HFCLK)
- Configure oscillators
    - Internal Oscillators (SYSOSC, SYSPLL)
    - External Oscillators (High/low frequency crystal oscillators)
- Configure clock interrupts
- View all clock output frequencies

Check the datasheet of your selected device for more detailed information.
